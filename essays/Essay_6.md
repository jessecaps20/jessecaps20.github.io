<h3>Checkpoint A:
Describe your design for your site’s shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart.</h3>
For this assignment I am designing a separate cart that the user will be able to access at anytime from the nav bar. An example is that once you are done browsing the products you select a quantity and then click add to cart. Once you are done adding things you click cart in the nav bar to go see what’s in your cart and what you have previously viewed, and then login or register to checkout.
<h3>Checkpoint B:
Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data). Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their keys) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will beused in $_SESSION. </h3>
When users log in they will have their own session. when they click the add to cart button the quantities and other info will be saved to that session as a JSON object 
<h3>Checkpoint C:
How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?</h3>
A big security concern for me is a data breach that would reveal a user's personal and login information to the hacker. At this point I don’t know too much about cyber security but from what I do know I will use a server verification with cookies to make sure whoever is using the site has an account and if not they will have to register before reaching the checkout page.
<h3>Checkpoint D:
Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary):</h3>
I am going to have the users thanked by their name. I am planning on using an alert box to do it like I did in Project 2
<h3>Checkpoint E:
If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible? That is, who is doing what and when?</h3>
I have been working alone. 
<h3>Checkpoint F:
How are you approching Assigment 3 differently than Aassignment 2?</h3>
I am constantly testing as I go and making many backups at certain points. During assignment 2 I had many times where I would do a lot of coding and then it would not work and then I could not figure out where I went wrong without screwing up my whole project. I am also going to experiment with w3schools templates. I haven’t really dabbled that much with them but I am this time.
<br>
<br><br>All in all, I have been approaching this assignment very methodically and it has been working well for me. I started a little late but I am on schedule to finish before the deadline. I can’t wait to turn this project in, life has kind of sucked and been rough as of late and It’s starting to affect my schoolwork so I’m happy to turn this in soon.
