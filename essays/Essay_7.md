<h3>What was accomplished in the project as compared to what was planned?</h3>
I would say that I accomplished less than I planned with the project. I started off with a lot of plans and then when I would try and implement something new it would affect something that was previously working. I wanted to try and incorporate cookies way more and do something like a previously viewed screen that would disappear after a set amount of time but it was too problematic for me so I ultimately had to abandon it. Cookies gave me the most problems out of anything. I learned a lot and had fun though, when your actually designing a full website and seeing the results it can be pretty fun! In the end I had to cut a lot out in the 11th hour in order to be able to submit on time. I realoze I will probably lose some points but I am still trying to fix more issues after the deadline. I feel like if I worked with a partner they would have been able to complete what I was not able to.
<h3>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</h3>
I could not add an option to remove items or clear the cart because I was having so many issues with cookies. I also wanted to get an actual rockstar’s seal of approval to put on my site but none responded to my Instagram DM’s
<h3>What was your biggest project risk and how was it managed?</h3>
My biggest project risk was trying to figure out how to make the previously viewed items appear in your cart and then disappear after a certain amount of time. I wasted a lot of time trying to do that and eventually had to scrap that version of my site all together. So that was my biggest risk and it did not pay off.
<h3>What is your assessment of the overall quality of the system?</h3>
 I think it works well and looks great. I tried to do mostly everything in CSS and try and make it look as good as possible that way. That was the most fun part of the project for me was designing and laying out all the pages myself
<h3>What is needed before this system can be placed into operation?</h3>
More security for sure. It would be pretty easy to get in to the system as someone else. I don’t know a whole lot about cyber security but I want to learn and be able to implement it into future projects
<h3>Describe what you are most proud of about this project:</h3>
 That I was able to have fun while doing it. I never thought this would be too fun but It was really fun especially being able to design a website for rock stars and venues because I love playing guitar, myself. I am also proud that my fellow classmates are so willing to help out a fellow student. Props to everyone who helped, you guys are awesome.
<h3>Describe what you are least happy with this project:</h3>
That I wasn’t able to implement too many of the things that I set out to do. I understand programming waaaaaay more now than I did at the beginning of the semester but it is still very confusing. Also not happy with the lack of sleep toward the end.
