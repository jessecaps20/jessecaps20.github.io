<h3>Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details</h3>
Assignment 2 was a doozy. For this assignment we had to upgrade our stores from assignment 1 to include a login and registration page. The site needed to require a user to log in or register before purchasing and save any newly registered users.

<h3>What did you learn from this assignment?</h3>
What I learned more from this assignment was that it was imperative to understand what each section of code did as there was less guidance than assignment 1. If I wanted to implement an example from class or the workshop I needed to fully understand how it worked in order to implement it successfully or without screwing up the rest of my project. I also learned to try and visualize the project as a whole instead of individual sections.
<h3>Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).</h3>
I did not work with a partner so I get the full 100% (whoop whoop!)
<h3>How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?</h3>
When I needed help I tried to figure it out myself first by using StackOverflow and YouTube videos. If I still wasn’t able to figure it out I found it most beneficial to talk the problem through with one of my classmates or get an extra set of eyes if I was experiencing a bug. There was a specific time when I was burnt out after trying to fix a bug for a couple hours and I just could NOT figure it out. I asked my classmate Phil to look it over for me and he found that it had been a simple spelling mistake that was causing my issue. The second set of eyes is extremely valuable.
<h3>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?</h3>
It was different in that there were more complex parts to develop for the project but I didn’t feel totally lost like I did in Assignment 1 because I had my Assignment 1 to build on instead of starting from scratch.
<h3>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</h3>
I probably spent about 15% of the time thinking about what I wanted to do, 35% writing the code, and 50% testing and debugging. I have found that when I’m programming whether I spend an hour or 2 days planning I still run into a ton of problems so I like to get a general Idea of what I want to do and then start trying things out. I also feel like this helps with my creative process as I am able to develop solutions to new problems as I go and change my original plan to something different that I didn’t even think of in my planning stage. I spend about 50% of my time testing and debugging because I'm still not proficient at coding hehe.
<h3>Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?</h3>
What worked well for this project was that I was able to better visualize the parts of my project as a whole and how I wanted to implement them. What didn’t work well was that even when I visualized what I needed to do I had a hard time actually implementing specifics within the code to get things done.
<h3>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?</h3>
If I could go back in time and do anything differently I would just try and stress out less. Whenever I encountered a problem I could not solve I would get stressed and then try a bunch of different fixes in my code which would lead to me making even more problems. Instead I would have taken a step back, taken a breath to de-stress, and systematically tested small sections of code where I was having problems.
