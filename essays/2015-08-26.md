My name is Jesse Capalbo, I am majoring in Management Information Systems at Shidler. I was born and raised in New York . After I graduated Highschool I Enlisted in the United States Airforce for 4 years where I moved to Florida and worked as an electrician on The F-16 Fighting Falcon jet. After I left the Air Force I spent half a year Hiking the 2200 mile Appalachian trail before deciding to move to Hawaii.

I am pursuing MIS as my major because I am interested in briding the gap between the tech and business worlds. I hope to get into IT project management after I get my degree and eventually earn my MBA.
