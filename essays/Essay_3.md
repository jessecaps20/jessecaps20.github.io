Invoice 1 WOD was a bit of a step of from the other WODs. I initially tried to work through the WOD without the help of the screencast but I had to refer to the screen cast at times in order to get over some humps.

I prepared for this WOD by going over the readings and viewing the screencasts. I also found freecodecamp.org to be very helpful in honing my javascript skills!

Much of the program I was able to get through relatively smoothly up until I could not get my dynamic groups to work. It is oh so easy to overlook the importance of a ` in the code. After that I got everything mostly working. So far everything up to this point is fairly intuitive but I have a feeling that is about to change in the coming months…

One big issue that I keep running into is that sometimes I’ll neglect to change the number of an item after copy and pasting it to my code. I also constantly misspell things which is just suuuper annoying but I am getting better at it. The further we go on the more challenging the coding becomes but also more fun and interesting. I am looking forward to the rest of the WODs and semester.
