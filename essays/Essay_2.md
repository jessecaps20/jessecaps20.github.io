WOD 1 for BrowserHistory1 took me a while to complete. I wanted to fully commit and try and learn on my own so I kept working at it until I completed it without watching the screencast solution. Once I finished and watched the screencast it seemed that I came to the same conclusion in a very similar way with only a few differences in the code. It was a fun learning experience to try and fully figure it out for myself. After practicing I got my WOD time to under 20 minutes.

WOD 2 for BrowserHistory2 was pretty straight forward. With the exception of figuring out how to link the fonts that were not a part of VS Code everything else was a matter of intuitively guessing which commands to use to complete the list of requirements. This WOD showed me how useful and fun CSS can be. After practicing I got my WOD time to under 10 minutes.

WOD 3 took a little more time for me. I was able to pick up the DIV and class aspects pretty quickly but I took a long while on the columns. There are CSS commands that are specifically made for columns and grids and such. However, after spending a lot of time trying to get them to work I had to ditch the effort. I did end up with columns but they were equal length columns which essentially didnâ€™t align my H2 headings under the introduction paragraph. It looked more like a newspaper where columns feed into new columns and headings are often in the middle of the page instead of aligned at the top like lists. After a while of trying to figure this out I caved and watched the screencast and saw that the method was completely different than mine. I took time to understand how it worked and then replicated it for myself. The Navigation bar I thought was fairly easy and I was able to accomplish that in a few minutes. After practicing I got my WOD time to under 10 minutes.

I am beginning to get more comfortable with HTML and CSS and am able to increasingly figure things out faster.
