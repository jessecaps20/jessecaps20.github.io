<h3>My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:</h3>
My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways: My programming skills have improved in the aspect that I now know all that goes into making a web application. There are many more parts than I thought would need to go into building a web application but over the course of 352 I have slowly been able to see what the parts do individually and how they come together to complete a whole. I can also understand what the individual parts of the application do by looking at the code, I can sort of “understand” it as a different language.
<h3>I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</h3>
I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills: I need to work on thinking more creatively and on my own instead of following too closely to the directions. I guess this ties into my lack of coding experience but for assignment 1 I stuck very closely to the examples and what Professor Port had showed us in class even though there were things I would have liked to done differently on my assignment I could not get them to work together cohesively and then I began to panic that I would not complete my assignment in time so I went back to the “safe” method of constructing the assignment by following examples. I need to have more confidence in myself.
<h3>I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions first.</h3>
I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions first. I can do this for the most part. If it is a WOD that is building on a previous WOD I can usually do this pretty well. However, if the material is new (and difficult) I may have to watch the screencast first and then attempt the WOD.
<h3>The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.</h3>
The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence. The labs were extremely helpful, especially how we would use parts from our completed labs on later assignments and then would be able to see how the earlier work we did actually fit into the scope of the class. I liked how the structure of the class was to actually work through the labs and not just have them be homework. They are laid out in a step by step way that helps the learning process and I can now complete them with confidence.
<h3>I feel ready I am ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications like Assignment 1).</h3>
I feel ready I am ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications like Assignment 1). I do feel relatively comfortable to work on the next stage of complexity in programming. I feel like assignment 1 really helped me see how the individual parts function as a whole and I am excited to work with a partner just to be able to constantly bounce ideas off of each other and help one another when we get stuck. I think this will greatly help the learning process.
<h3>I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</h3>
I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways: I think the implementation of small groups or something would help a lot in this class for reasons I mentioned in the above question., maybe have mini assignments with your assigned small group just to try and figure things out together and help each other learn.
<h3>These are things that work really well for my learning in this class:</h3>
These are things that work really well for my learning in this class: I think things that worked really well was the fact that I didn’t have to worry or stress about “learning things for the test” I was able to have that relief that I would not fail based on tests and I could focus on using the knowledge toward our projects and applications which allowed me to able to try and fail on my own time in order to actually help me learn the material. The recorded lectures were also extremely valuable. Being able to go back and watch parts of the lecture that I didn’t fully understand or needed to reference back to was extremely valuable.
